Description: Annotated HPLC-ESI-MS lipid data in positive ionization
        mode from an experiment in which cultures of the marine diatom
        Phaeodactylum tricornutum were treated with various
        concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce oxidative
        stress. The experiment is described in Graff van Creveld, et
        al., 2015, "Early perturbation in mitochondria redox
        homeostasis in response to environmental stress predicts cell
        fate in diatoms," ISME Journal 9:385-395. PtH2O2lipids consists
        of two objects: A CAMERA xsAnnotate object
        (ptH2O2lipids$xsAnnotate) and LOBSTAHS LOBSet object
        (ptH2O2lipids$xsAnnotate$LOBSet). The LOBSet includes putative
        compound assignments from the default LOBSTAHS database. Isomer
        annotation is recorded in three other LOBSet slots.
