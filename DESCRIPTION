Description: Annotated HPLC-ESI-MS lipid data in positive ionization mode from
    an experiment in which cultures of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum
    tricornutum were treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide
    (H2O2) to induce oxidative stress. The experiment is described in Graff van
    Creveld, et al., 2015, "Early perturbation in mitochondria redox homeostasis
    in response to environmental stress predicts cell fate in diatoms," ISME
    Journal 9:385-395. PtH2O2lipids consists of two objects: A CAMERA xsAnnotate
    object (ptH2O2lipids$xsAnnotate) and LOBSTAHS LOBSet object
    (ptH2O2lipids$xsAnnotate$LOBSet). The LOBSet includes putative compound
    assignments from the default LOBSTAHS database. Isomer annotation is
    recorded in three other LOBSet slots.
